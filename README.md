=================

These are some useful resources that I found while looking for infosec resources
online.

# Low-level programming
* https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assemblyhttps://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly
** This is a wikibook about x86 assembly language and architecture
* https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Disassembly
** This book is about disassembling binaries written for the x86 architecture,
and is a nice complement to the above book
