# Infosec Resources

These are some useful resources that I found while looking for infosec information online.

## Low-level programming
* x86 Assembly: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assemblyhttps://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly - This is a wikibook about x86 assembly language and architecture
* x86 Disassembly: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Disassembly - This book is about disassembling binaries written for the x86 architecture, and is a nice complement to the above book.  It also has a few good sections on x86 instructions and general calling conventions etc.

## Reverse Engineering
* Reverse engineering with Radare2: https://samsymons.com/blog/reverse-engineering-with-radare2-part-1/ (links to the next link)
* Binary exploitation course: http://security.cs.rpi.edu/courses/binexp-spring2015/

## Disassemblers
* The bastard disassembler: http://bastard.sourceforge.net/
